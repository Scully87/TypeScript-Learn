:notebook: TYPESCRIPT BABY!!! :notebook:
=======================

###I'm a nailer, so i'm gonna nail the basics of TypeScript


######The tsc command is the TypeScript compiler, and it immediately generates a new file called hello.js. Our TypeScript application does not use any TypeScript-specific syntax, so we see the same exact JavaScript code in hello.js that we wrote in hello.ts.

######If an error is valid within the *.ts file, the compiler will still generate the *.js file. The error doesn't stop the TypeScript compiler from generating the corresponding JavaScript, but the compiler does warn us of potential issues.
